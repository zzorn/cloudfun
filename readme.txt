Cloudfun is a middleware library that provides game centered storage and task execution for local, remote, or multi-node servers.

Written in Scala.

Provides both server and client side API:s.

Goals:

* Provide persistent entities.
* Task support, preferably atomic and fault-tolerant.
* Support for sending actions from clients to the server, and perceptions from the server to the client.
* Ability to run a local server, or separate server accessed over the network
* Some multi-node support for servers to allow scaling.
* (binary) serialization for network data.
